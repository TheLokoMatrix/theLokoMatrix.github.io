						<h3 class="post-title">Getting my Head Around This</h3>
						<div class="post-content">
							<p>It's been quite a day trying to get my head around arrays and functions. Trying to understand why things react the way they do, some bits kind of confuse me. I think the trickiest thing about learning this on MIMO is that there's no one there that I can ask, it's just me and what's been presented to me. I am seriously considering joining Code Acadamy now, at least there are others there that I can interact with.</p>
							<p>I've linked my github to my iPad thus using Working Copy and Textastic to update my website. This is pretty cool, and it presents a nice workflow. I've also scalled out somewhat of a plan on what projects I want to work on. this is exciting, and feels more real everyday. The more I do this, the more I want to do, this is different from any type of work I've done before.</p>
							<p>I soon want to learn swift and start developing apps, with xcode 'apparently' coming to the iPad, working on here is going to be absolutely amazing. The iPad has so much in a central place, with great workflow and presentation, it's absolutely amazing</p>

							<h3 class="post-title">The Journey Begins</h3>
						<div class="post-content">
							<p>For the longest time I forgot what I loved when I was younger. Introduced to the world of computing by my uncle, I became very excited about it, but along the way, I became distracted by other things and lost my way. For years, although I exelled areas of work, I never became satisfied for one reason or the other.</p> 
							<p>Recently I've remembered my love for computing, and I am really excited by the prospect of coding and programming. The prodigal son has returned, and I will introduce the world to The Loko Matrix.</p>
